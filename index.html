        My name is Nikos and i am 13 years old. I recently started html and css but i am still learning javascript so i am not good at it at all. Also i know the programming language python which is really cool. I play a lot of sports like tennis, football, basketball, etc. Finally, i live in Greece and know 3 different languages:
            <ol type="1">
            <strong>English</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>France</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>Russian</strong>(a little bit..)
            </ol>

      <br>
      I firstly got inspiration by the youtuber called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4SVo0Ue36XCfOyb5Lh1viQ" target="_blank"><strong>Bro Code</strong> </a> who is a very good and successful youtuber and explains everything really good and makes sure that it is easily understandable.
      <br>
      <br>
      Another reason is started programming is because some of my friends programmed so i decided to start too.
